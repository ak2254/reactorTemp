Throughout the course of the year, I have been actively engaged in working on two primary power applications, namely the Solution Record Application and the Poise Scheduler Application. These experiences have significantly deepened my understanding of various processes within the plant. For instance, in the Solution Record Application, I gained insights into how core support meticulously tracks solutions, manages their discarding, and addresses errors on the floor, along with identifying areas for improvement.

Similarly, working on the Poise Scheduler Application provided me with valuable knowledge about how QCA (Quality Control Analysts) and QCM (Quality Control Managers) leverage MSP (Manufacturing Support Platform) data and operations to allocate resources efficiently. This experience broadened my understanding of sample processes within the plant.

Additionally, my involvement in developing multiple Python scripts has contributed to my enhanced comprehension of plant operations. These scripts encompassed various aspects, including project supply planning, MSP data analysis, buffer and media preparation data, and PI data for connected plant operations. This comprehensive exposure has enriched my skills and knowledge in handling diverse data sets and utilizing Python for practical applications in the plant environment.

In addition to my involvement in the main PowerApps projects, I have also contributed by developing small components as supplementary elements to other ongoing projects. This collaborative effort has allowed me to extend the impact of my work beyond the primary applications, providing valuable enhancements to various aspects of different projects.
