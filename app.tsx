My current goal is to implement Power BI dashboards to optimize data analytics and visualization for operations and quality. So far, I have developed dashboards across four major areas: Knowledge Management, Quality, Business Excellence, and Maintenance.

In Knowledge Management, I developed a ComplianceWire Overdue and Pending Training dashboard to track missed or pending training, now utilized site-wide to support training compliance.

For Quality, I built six reports based on SolTrack data, focusing on open/closed Event Reports with detailed analysis on CAPAs and resolutions.

In Business Excellence, I created dashboards for HUP Audits and 5S Area Audits, driving insights for continuous improvement initiatives.

For Maintenance, I developed a Reorder Parts dashboard to identify items that need restocking, a Bad Actors dashboard analyzing asset performance, and an Inventory Analytics dashboard to provide an overview of inventory status.

Each dashboard is equipped with automated refreshes, eliminating manual updates and enhancing data reliability and accessibility for cross-functional teams.
