Subject: Initial Draft for Calendar View

Hi Everyone,

Sharing the initial draft we’ve created for the calendar view. Please take a look and let us know your feedback.

We do have a few questions:

Can you please confirm all the work types we have mapped so far?
What tooltips would you like to see in this view?
What colors should be associated with each work type? Currently, we have three colors—please let us know if any changes are needed.
Please let us know if anything else is required or if any modifications are needed.

Looking forward to your thoughts!
