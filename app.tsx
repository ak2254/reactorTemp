I have developed and completed several applications to support this goal.

Key projects include the DNCM PowerApp, developed in collaboration with Martin Qui, which tracks damaged and non-conforming material processes. This application is equipped with automated workflows that guide users through the next steps based on their selections. Currently, it manages 632 records, streamlining what was previously a manual, paper-based process.

Additionally, I created SAP Requests and POMS Requests trackers for the Digital Systems team. Both applications feature user-based views: a submission form accessible to all users and an admin view that provides insights into all submitted requests. These PowerApps enhance efficiency by simplifying request tracking and providing real-time visibility for administrators
