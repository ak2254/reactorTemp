My current goal is to implement Power BI dashboards that optimize data analytics and visualization for operations and quality. So far, I have developed dashboards across three major areas: Quality, Business Excellence, and Maintenance. For Maintenance, I created a Reorder Parts dashboard to identify which parts need restocking, a Bad Actors dashboard for asset performance analysis, and an Inventory Analytics dashboard to provide overall insights into inventory health.

In Quality, I developed dashboards for the Knowledge Management team, including a ComplianceWire Overdue and Pending Training dashboard that tracks missed or pending training, which is now used site-wide. I also built six different reports based on SolTrack data, focusing on open/closed Event Reports and providing analysis on CAPAs and resolutions.

For Business Excellence, I worked on HUP Audits and 5S Areas Audits dashboards, which support continuous improvement efforts. Additionally, for the Controls team, I developed a dashboard to monitor DCS password changes, which includes automated quarterly email alerts to users.

Each dashboard is equipped with automated refreshes, eliminating any manual data updates and enhancing efficiency for users across various teams."
