Prefect Flows CI/CD Workflow – Step by Step
Phase 0: Prerequisites
Prefect server is running (e.g., ka2345.abc.com:4200)
Prefect work pools and workers are configured (e.g., dev-pool)
GitHub repository created with:
flows/ directory for flow code
deployments/dev/ (and optionally prod/) for deployment configs
.github/workflows/ for GitHub Actions workflows
Self-hosted GitHub Actions runner installed on the server (or local machine for testing)
Secrets added in GitHub: PREFECT_API_URL, PREFECT_API_KEY
Phase 1: Local Development
Developer writes/updates flows in flows/ directory.
Updates deployment configs in deployments/dev/deployment-configs.yaml.
Tests flows locally:
python flows/examples/hello_world.py
Phase 2: Push Code to GitHub
Commit your changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Add/update flow"
git push origin dev
GitHub automatically detects the push and triggers the Dev workflow.
Phase 3: GitHub Actions Runner
The self-hosted runner (on server or local machine) picks up the workflow job.
Workflow executes steps:
Checkout repo: actions/checkout@v4 → pulls latest code automatically.
Install Python dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Prefect CLI (API URL, API key, SSL cert if needed)
Apply deployment configs:
prefect deployment apply deployments/dev/deployment-configs.yaml
Phase 4: Prefect Deployment Registration
Prefect server reads the deployment configs.
Creates or updates deployments defined in the YAML file (e.g., hello-world-dev).
Existing deployments not listed in the YAML are untouched.
Phase 5: Flow Execution by Workers
Prefect workers connected to the pool (and optional queue) detect new or updated deployments.
When scheduled or manually triggered:
Worker picks up the job
Executes the flow code (latest version from the server checkout)
Logs and outputs are sent to Prefect UI
Phase 6: Feedback / Monitoring
Developer or team can verify:
Deployments in Prefect UI (hello-world-dev)
Manual runs via UI → logs show latest code executed
Scheduled runs happen automatically (if a schedule is set)
Phase 7: Production Deployment (Optional)
Once flows are tested in Dev:
Create a pull request: dev → main
Merge PR → triggers Prod workflow on server runner
Prod workflow steps are the same as Dev workflow but:
Uses deployments/prod/deployment-configs.yaml
Uses Prod secrets (PREFECT_API_URL_PROD, PREFECT_API_KEY_PROD)
Deploys flows to Prod environment, ready for workers to execute
Phase 8: Repeat for Updates
Any future changes:
Update flows locally
Push to dev → Dev workflow runs → Prefect Dev deployment updated
Test → merge to main → Prod workflow runs → Prefect Prod updated

Key Points
Runner on same server as workers → no VPN or network drive needed.
Checkout step ensures server always has latest repo.
Only deployments listed in YAML are updated — other flows are untouched.
CI/CD process works with one branch for dev and optionally main for prod.
