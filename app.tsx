"""
    Attempts to send a notification asynchronously with a timeout.

    This block performs the following steps:
    - Initiates the notification sending process by calling the `notify` function.
    - Runs `notify` in an executor to avoid blocking the event loop.
    - Uses `asyncio.wait_for` to enforce a timeout on the notification operation.
    - If successful within the timeout, retrieves the status and timestamp.
    - Handles a timeout or any other exceptions by updating the notification request status and raising appropriate HTTP exceptions.

    Parameters:
        timeout (float): The maximum time to wait for the notification to be sent.
        loop (asyncio.AbstractEventLoop): The event loop to run the executor.
        notify (function): The function that sends the notification.
        request (NotificationRequestCreate): The notification request data containing:
            - client_path (str): Path to the client.
            - msg (str): The message to be sent.
            - groups (List[str]): Groups to receive the notification.
            - destinations (List[str]): Specific destinations for the notification.
            - subject (str): Subject of the notification.
        db (AsyncSession): The database session for updating the notification status.
        new_request (NotificationRequest): The new notification request record in the database.

    Exceptions Handled:
        asyncio.TimeoutError:
            - Occurs if the notification sending exceeds the specified timeout.
            - Logs an error, updates the notification status to "timeout," and raises an HTTP 504 exception.
        Exception:
            - Catches all other exceptions.
            - Logs the error message, updates the notification status to "failed," and raises an HTTP 500 exception.

    Raises:
        HTTPException:
            - HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout if a timeout occurs.
            - HTTP 500 Internal Server Error for any other exceptions.

    Returns:
        tuple:
            - status (str): The status returned by the `notify` function upon successful execution.
            - timestamp (str): The timestamp returned by the `notify` function.
