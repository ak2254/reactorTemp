📁 1. Define Scope and Requirements
✅ Identify data sources: H: drives, L: drives, SharePoint, Teams folders, OneDrive, etc.

✅ Define what metadata you want: filename, filepath, owner, last modified, keywords inside file.

✅ Determine who will use it: just you, your team, or the whole site.

🧾 2. Get Necessary Permissions
✅ Request access to shared folders or automate access requests.

✅ Ensure legal and compliance approval (especially for H: drive or personal files).

✅ Define access boundaries: scan only shared/team folders, not personal ones unless authorized.

⚙️ 3. Build File Indexing Pipeline
Use Python or a low-code solution to extract metadata and index contents.

✅ Scan files (recursively) in L:/H:/SharePoint locations using Python (os, pathlib, pywin32, or SharePlum/Office365-REST).

✅ Extract metadata: filename, path, last modified, file owner (can get via os.stat, AD queries, or SharePoint API).

✅ Extract text content for indexing (use textract, PyPDF2, docx, or pandas for Excel).

✅ Store in a central database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, or even a CSV to start).

🧠 4. Build a Search Engine
✅ Use Whoosh, Elasticsearch, or Haystack for full-text search.

✅ Index content + metadata for searchability.

✅ Store search queries and results for audit/logging (especially useful in pharma).

🔍 5. Build Search Interface
✅ Simple web app using Streamlit, FastAPI + React, or Flask.

✅ Input: search bar with natural language or keywords.

✅ Output: list of matching files with title, path, owner, and preview snippet.

Example result:

Match: "ANC Testing Formula"
📄 File: anc_testing_v3.xlsx
📍 Path: L:\QC\Stability\ANC Formulas\2023
👤 Owner: Chris R.
🕒 Last Modified: May 14, 2024

🔐 6. Secure and Maintain
✅ Add user login if others will use it.

✅ Add access filters (e.g., don’t show files users can’t open).

✅ Schedule re-indexing (daily/weekly) using Prefect or Windows Task Scheduler.

✅ Set alerts for unreadable paths or moved files.

🚀 Optional Enhancements
🔎 Add fuzzy search or synonyms (e.g., “ANC test formula” = “ANC formulation”).

📂 Enable file previews (PDF, Word, Excel).

🧠 Integrate with an LLM to answer questions about file content, not just find the file.
