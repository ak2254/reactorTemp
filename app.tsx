You’ll deeply understand how modern LLM-powered apps are architected.

You’ll see how all components (prompting, embeddings, vector search, APIs, UI) fit together into a single working system.

✅ Best for: Full-stack learners, builders, and tinkerers who want a unified deep-dive from idea to deployment.

🔍 2. AI Engineering Bootcamp: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Zero To Mastery)
https://zerotomastery.io/courses/ai-engineer-bootcamp-retrieval-augmented-generation/
📘 What You’ll Learn:
Deep LLM + transformer theory (tokenization, self-attention)

RAG internals (chunking, embedding strategies, vector DB search)

LangChain and OpenAI agents

Advanced prompting + multi-step pipelines

Multi-modal RAG (e.g. image + text)

Real-world projects: finance, cooking, chatbots

🧠 How It Expands Your Knowledge:
Makes you an “AI engineer,” not just a user.

You’ll learn how to design and troubleshoot custom pipelines.

Gives you depth in retrieval, document QA, and multi-agent workflows.

📘 What You’ll Learn:
LangChain basics (Chains, Agents, Tools, Memory)

Building simple RAG pipelines

How to interact with LLMs modularly

Quick demos for document Q&A

🧠 How It Expands Your Knowledge:
Gives you a quick-start into LangChain and composable LLM systems.

You’ll learn modular thinking: how to break LLM systems into pieces (retriever, prompt, generator, etc.)

✅ Best for: Beginners or those who want to start coding fast with LLMs.

🔍 4. Master RAG: Ultimate Retrieval-Augmented Generation Course (Udemy)
📘 What You’ll Learn:
Advanced RAG techniques: chunking, reranking, retrieval fusion

Tools: LangChain, LlamaIndex, FAISS, Pinecone

Agents and tool usage in RAG

Fine-tuning retrieval and evaluation (RAGAS)

🧠 How It Expands Your Knowledge:
You’ll go beyond basic RAG and learn optimization techniques.

Focused knowledge on how to scale, evaluate, and make RAG more accurate.

🔍 5. Hugging Face – LLM Course
📘 What You’ll Learn:
Transformer mechanics: attention, embeddings, architecture

Training vs. fine-tuning vs. inference

Hugging Face library (model loading, pipelines, inference)

Evaluation, deployment (Gradio, Streamlit)

🧠 How It Expands Your Knowledge:
You’ll understand LLMs from the ground up: how they work, how to run them locally, and how to fine-tune or share them.

Great exposure to open-source tooling.

✅ Best for: Developers and researchers wanting control over models (not just using OpenAI APIs).

🔍 6. Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (FutureLearn)
📘 What You’ll Learn:
Hybrid search (BM25 + dense)
